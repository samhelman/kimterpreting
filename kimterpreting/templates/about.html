        I am a registered Registered Sign Language Interpreter based in Wokingham, Berkshire. 
        I provide interpretation services between British Sign Language (BSL) and English 
        (Spoken or Written). My interest in British Sign Language began after attending a basic 
        BSL course in 2009. Since then I have worked my way through the Signature NVQ levels in 
        British Sign Language.  Whilst working as a Trainee Interpreter, I achieved the SLI 
        Advanced Diploma in BSL-English Interpreting and Translation in 2017 and registered 
        with NRCPD as a Registered Sign Language Interpreter (RSLI). In addition to the formal 
        qualifications, I have completed workshops and courses including Sign Language Linguistics 
        taught by Rachel Sutton-Spence, Theatre Sign's Introduction to Theatre Interpreting and 
        Voices-Off Weekends run by Signamic. I enjoy volunteering and have been fortunate enough 
        to work with organisations such as Sense and at national events including Deaf World, 
        Reading Festival and London Pride.
        <br><br>
        I have a BSc (hons) degree in Applied Psychology and Sociology from the University 
        of Surrey and have worked in non-interpreting roles in Mental Health and Adult Social 
        Care settings since 2004.
        <br><br>
        My other interests include amateur dramatics and singing, tending to my garden with 
        the 'assistance' of my cats and cycling. In fact I am so well known for riding my bike 
        that my sign name in the Deaf community is the sign for 'cycling'. 
        <br><br>
        Punctuality and preparation are important to me and I am professional and flexible 
        in my approach.
        <br><br>
        Please do not hesitate to contact me if you would like to ask any questions. I'm 
        always happy to discuss interpreting and if I am not able to assist, I am part of a 
        wide network of professional interpreters so I will usually be able to put you in 
        touch with someone who can meet your requirements.
